# Multicore_Project
 
## Problem
To implement a **weight free vector** in Rust and to show performance benefits when compared against C++. Weâ€™ll do a detailed performance comparison (time and memory efficiency) between the two implementations, and between other implementations of a thread safe vector in Rust and C++. 

## Prior Research
We will be using this [Paper](https://www.osti.gov/pages/servlets/purl/1427291) to implement the solution in Rust.
